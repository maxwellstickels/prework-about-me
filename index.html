      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Just a dude typing on the computer! :)</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>My home is in lovely Valley Spings, California, though I am currently enrolled at Caltech.</p>
      <p>Current events keep me at home; otherwise I would be down in also-lovely Pasadena.</p>
      <h1>Favorite Hobbies</h1>
      <p>For as long as I can remember, I've enjoyed messing around on computers and pianos.</p>
      <h1>Dream Job</h1>
      <p>Software development is the field. Good luck getting me to decide on a specific job though.</p>
      <h1>Why do I want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>It's a safer software development option for me, since I have more experience with it.</p>
      <p>I do really enjoy this kind of programming, though I am still open to other career paths.</p>
